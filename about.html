<div id="flip">Attack on titan reviews</div>
<div id="panel">Attack on Titan follows protagonist Eren Yeager in a world where humans live within the safety of 3 circular fifty-metre¹ high walls. Safe from the man-eating titans (deformed giants with human appearances normally between 3–15 metres tall) that kill humans mercilessly out of pleasure. Eren is forced into the world of nightmares when his outer-city, Shiganshina, and the outer ring wall (wall Maria) is shockingly breached by the unknown colossus Titan (60 metres tall) and the armoured titan. He is determined to eradicate titans and reclaim their land, accompanied by his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman — charged to keep Eren safe — and his bestfriend Armin Arlert. Their journey together takes them down many dangerous and perilous paths, learning truths they wished were false. It’s a constant race between life and death, with many characters you meet not making it past an episode, and some you sit anxiously on the edge of your seat hoping they will.</div>

<div id="flip">Erased reviews</div>
<div id="panel">The basic premise of ERASED is not totally unique - Time Travel. There has been a lot of movies and shows based on this concept but ERASED stands apart for several reasons.

1) Pace:: The anime moves at a soothing pace. It's neither too fast nor too slow, but ideal and so, it never gets boring or too hard to follow.

2) Character Development:: There are a lot of anime in which even after watching 100-200 episodes, one would never feel empathetic with the characters. But in ERASED, even from episode 1, all the characters seem so real and you would really feel connected with at least one of them.

3) Narration:: This is one of the few anime which shows the lead character thinking out his strategy. Like Code Geass and Death Note, you will get a clear picture about the insights.

4) Animation Quality:: It has one of the best screenplays! There is also a lot of attention to details and colors are used very effectively to convey the message / emotions of the characters.

It is definitely worth a watch, especially given that it is a short series.</div>

<div id="flip">Fire Force review</div>
<div id="panel">I'll dispense quickly with the Soul Eater nod. If you liked that you'll LOVE this! Because as great as Soul Eater was, Fire Force is an order of magnitude even better.

First let's talk artwork and animation. Both are at the head of the class as far as anime goes. There have been some wonderfully animated series lately - Demon Slayer and Mob Psycho 100 to name just two. Fire Force surpasses anything I have seen in a long time.

Artwork and character design are also near or at the top of the heap. The characters, like in Soul Eater, are simplistic in the art, but their emotional designs and personalities balance that out, with some truly sophisticated powers and backstories.

The series is well written and there is hardly a moment that doesn't race the viewer through something truly dramatic, or isn't lending depth, not only to the main character, but almost the entire supporting cast, both friend and foe. The writers are to be commended.

Great direction in how the various scenes are played out, especially the action scenes. And I found the voice acting crew does a great job in helping flesh out the emotional responses and social interactions between all the characters; fine job, indeed.

Feeling a little bored in your Covid lockdown?? Check out Fire Force. It's enthusiasm will fire you back up again.</div>
